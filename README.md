# QuickKV
#### A pretty fast monster that I made for fun for a KeyValue parsing competition
I highly suggest against using this, as it's not really made for anything other than just parsing, and the code is not my finest work.</br>
If you want something actually usable, check out SpeedyKeyV https://github.com/ozxybox/SpeedyKeyV. It's only slightly slower than BulletKV, but works much bettter than all branches here.
